# DataShares
Access to the spatial data on its geospatial data servers (for NSOE affiliates only) 

Spatial data are located in the Data folder, within the SDE links. To access the data, open ArcCatalog (from within ArcMap or the application itself) and navigate to the Data folder. There will be three read-only SDE connections: NC contains data for North Carolina, NHD contains NHD+ (version 2) data, and US contains data for the entire US (Currently on NLCD datasets). 

These links will only work on Duke campus machines and are to be used only by NSOE students, faculty and staff - or others with authorization.
